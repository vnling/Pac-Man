### Instructions
<details>
  <summary>For Processing with Arduino</summary>
  <br/>
  My Arduino circuit consists of four momentary switches with a potentiometer. The switches provide directional input for the Pac-Man sprite, while the potentiometer can be used to select the level of difficulty in the start screen. The PacMan_Processing and PacMan_Arduino folders contain all files and code needed for this configuration.
